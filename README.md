# NLPFinanceCode

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze financial news headlines and predict stock market movement.

## Summary

The notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Loads a dataset containing labeled financial news headlines.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans the headlines using tokenization, stopword removal, and other NLP techniques.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text data into numerical format using TF-IDF vectorization.
4. **Model Training**: Trains machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes to classify sentiment.
5. **Evaluation**: Compares model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

The goal is to explore how headline sentiment correlates with stock price movement using classic ML classifiers.

## How to Use

Open the notebook `NLPFinanceCode.ipynb` in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
